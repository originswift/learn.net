# Exercise B1B (draft)
> The end goal of this exercise is to introduce the basics of integration testing in ASP.NET Core with xUnit & SpecFlow.NET/Gherkin.
> We will add an API layer to the solution in [Exercise B1A](./B1A.md), so that we can invoke the calculator methods via RESTful HTTP calls.
> This introduces ASP.NET Core DI (Dependency Injection).
> Also weakly/indirectly introduces ASP.NET Core Web API projects, the HTTP protocol, REST and OpenAPI/Swagger. These concepts should be properly researched.

## Tasks
